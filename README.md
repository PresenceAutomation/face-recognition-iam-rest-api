## General 
We recommend using HTTPS for all API access. All responses will be in JSON format, and all image uploads are to be performed as form-data (POST request). APIs without image uploads use application/json. Each individual API is explained in detail in the following section.


## Entities
There are 3 types of entities in this system. 

1. User
2. Group
3. Organization

##### 1. User
When an organization registers, an `admin user` is generated and credentials are provided to the organization's PoC, along with the `organizationId`. Using this more users can be registered into the system. Any person registered into an organization is by default a `user`. Further, the user can be made an `admin` or `groupAdmin`(discussed in 2.); these `roles` are assigned to the `user` to allow different levels of access to the system. `admin` and `groupAdmin` are allowed to create and register users. Similarly, the `admin` can re-register a user at a later time and also give the `user` the ability to re-add more of his/her faces at a later stage.

##### 2. Group
A `group` can represent a team or site or location or building or any other collection of people. While the `user` is used to authenticate a person, `group` is used for authorization and access. For instance, only `users` added to group `lab` would be allowed into a 'lab', in which case a person is authenticated as a user and then checked if he should be provided access to the 'lab' based on whether he/she is present in the group `lab`. The `groupAdmin` are the gate keepers to the group. They have the ability to provide access to any `user` or revoke as well. `groups` and `groupAdmin` are created by `admin`.

##### 3. Organization
All groups and users come under a single organization. The organization is created by the support team at HyperVerge or one of its partners. The `admin` are the gatekeepers to the organization. On creation, an `organizationId` is generated and would be shared.

#### User Privileges
There are 3 types of user roles in the system: `admin`, `groupAdmin` and a normal `user`. The privileges that each type of user can exercise are mentioned below:
 
##### Admin
Apart from everything that a Group Admin can do, an Admin user of the system can:<br>

* Create or delete a group
* Make a user an admin for the organization
* Delete a user
 
##### Group Admin
Apart from everything that a normal user can do, a Group Admin user of the system can:<br>

* Create and register a user
* Add a user to the group or remove user from group
* Make a user a group admin to the group

##### Normal User
A normal user of the system can:<br>

* Edit his/her details
* Add or remove his/her faces
<br>



## Authentication
All API calls need an `tenantId` and `tenantKey` to be sent with the header for authentication. The `tenantId` is used for billing. 
<br>


## Authorization
All API calls requiring authorization need a `token` to be sent with the header. The `token` would be generated by the system as a response to valid credentials or face verfication. The `token` can be obtained by authenticating with the username and OTP. All API calls made by an organization additionally need the `tenantId`
<br>

## Parameters
All optional and compulsory parameters are passed as part of the request body.

## Root Endpoint
A `GET` request can be issued to the root endpoint to check for successful connection : 

	 curl https://iam.hyperverge.co/v1 

The `plain/text` reponse of `"AoK!"` should be received.
